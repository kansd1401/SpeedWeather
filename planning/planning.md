# User Stories

- user should be able to see the overview of the weather superimposed on a map

- user can check the side tab for extra information regarding the weather in each city

- user sees the current weather information

- user can see updates on the weather every hour

# Teck Stack

- Reactjs, Google maps, WeatherStack api.

- We ended up with Reactjs, Mapbox and WeatherStack api.

# Limitations

- Api calls limit per day is usually 1000 for free we would need to pay if it exceeds.

- If somehow the website is being used by users not from the company and the calls per day increases we'll need user accounts to block the access off.

# Estimation

- Good probability of having a working proof of concept ready in the alotted time.
